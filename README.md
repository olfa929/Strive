**🏃‍♂️ StriveAI – AI Assistant for Marathon Athletes**

StriveAI is an intelligent platform that supports athletes and their medical teams in the crucial weeks leading up to a marathon. It leverages real-time biometric data from an integrated-circuit smart sports suit (not textile-based) and combines it with AI-driven digital twin simulations of the heart. This allows teams to monitor, predict, and optimize an athlete’s condition throughout intensive training.

**🌟 Key Features**

Smart Suit Integration: Collects continuous physiological signals (heart activity, sleep quality, overall medical state) from an advanced circuit-embedded sports suit.

Digital Twin of the Heart: Generates a virtual model of the athlete’s heart to simulate performance, detect anomalies, and predict injury risks.

AI-Powered Insights: Applies machine learning to detect patterns, forecast risks, and deliver actionable medical recommendations.

Medical Team Dashboard: Centralized, intuitive view for doctors and trainers to track athlete health during the pre-marathon period.

Personalized Athlete Profiles: Records height, weight, and marathon date for tailored monitoring and predictions.

Seamless Experience: Dark modern UI with smooth transitions, motivational visuals, and secure Supabase data storage.

## Model Training

The prediction model used in StriveAI was trained using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can find the training code and methodology in our [training notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ejv6TZXQWFKXviYrWUpvPiILPFk6jPS0?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwY2xjawMyck5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFydVZBcW1ndVlkWDlqWEkxAR6Gig4ylFWtqvXZaUMz1EGWUvcihoGqq-asrUf4eAln-DdZ8-1Aet52d11SKA_aem_ZhuDXyO4EyuhLvQaAiWu0A#scrollTo=Vp464D6qOejX).
