**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è StriveAI ‚Äì AI Assistant for Marathon Athletes
‚ùó Problem Statement**

Athletes preparing for marathons undergo intensive training periods that place enormous strain on their cardiovascular and overall health. Medical teams often lack real-time, precise, and predictive tools to continuously monitor an athlete‚Äôs condition. Traditional wearables provide limited insights and fail to forecast potential health risks before they become critical.

üí° **Solution**

StriveAI revolutionizes marathon preparation by combining data from an integrated-circuit smart sports suit (not textile-based) with AI-powered digital twin simulations of the heart. This allows medical teams to track athletes‚Äô medical state in real time, simulate heart performance under stress, and predict injury or health risks before they occur.

üåü ***Key Features***

**Smart Suit Integration**: Collects continuous biometric signals (heart activity, sleep quality, overall state) from a next-gen circuit-embedded sports suit.

**Digital Heart Twin**: Creates a virtual model of the athlete‚Äôs heart, enabling simulation, anomaly detection, and predictive insights.

**AI-Driven Monitoring**: Uses machine learning to identify patterns, forecast risks, and deliver intelligent recommendations.

**Medical Team Dashboard**: Provides a centralized, clear, and data-rich view of each athlete‚Äôs condition during training.

**Personalized Athlete Profiles**: Stores athlete-specific details (height, weight, marathon date) for customized tracking.

**Modern UX**: Dark theme, smooth transitions, motivational design, and secure Supabase integration for reliable data management.

‚ö° With StriveAI, marathon training becomes not only data-driven but also predictive, safe, and intelligent‚Äîempowering athletes to perform at their peak while minimizing health risks.
